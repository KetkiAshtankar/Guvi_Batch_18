SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
  1. Design
  2. Devlope
  3. Test
  4. Manintain

Phases in SDLC: 
Phase 1: Planning (Idea Generation)
Phase 2: Requirement Analysis 
Phase 3 : Design 
Phase 4: Devlopment (Coding)
Phase 5: Testing
Phase 6: Deployment 
Phase 7: Maintenance

SDLC Models
1. Waterfall Model
2. Agile Model
   a. Planning
   b. Devlopment
   c. Testing
   d. Feedback


**Waterfall **                      Agile
Linear and Sequential          Interitive and flexible
Changes difficult              Changes easy to accomodate
Minimal user involvment         High
Longer time to finish          Delivers functional parts faster
project  

**V-model **
Verification and Validation

Requirement Analysis     >   Acceptance testing
System Design            >   System Testing
High Level Design        >   Integration Testing
Detailed Design          >    Unit Testing



**Iterative Model**
plain 10 inches > show it > get feedback > add frosting > show it > 
add decoration > show it

rough block > shaped as human > refine it > carve details in face
> polish and finish


**agile model**
one cup cake > give it to customer > get feed back > improve flavour > repeat

make one part > the head
make torso
make arm
combine all part 



**Spiral Model **


**Big Bang Model**
